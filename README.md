# Django News

Django news will be the supporting framework for the new and improved 
Silver Chips Online website. Further specifications for things like data models,
site maps, and feature wishlists are stored in the boards and issues. Note that
while the intent is to keep this framework generic as to support news sites for
different organizations, parts may be hardocoded until a full fork and release.
