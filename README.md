# Django News

Django news will be the supporting framework for the new and improved 
Silver Chips Online website. Further specifications for things like data models,
site maps, and feature wishlists are stored in the documentation directory.

## Important Notes

- Currently the database for the test server is being synced via Git. This 
should be changed by the time the project is forked into Silver Chips Online.
